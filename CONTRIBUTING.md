## Setting Up mdBook (Optional)

mdBook is a command line tool and Rust crate to create books with Markdown. You can edit the markdown files (.md) in a text editor of your choice, but you wouldnâ€™t be able to view the rendered output in the book form with formatting. To view the book as intended, you will need to set up the mdBook CLI on your system.

mdBook can be installed with cargo, the package manager for Rust extensions. Cargo installation procedure is different depending on the OS youâ€™re running.

### Linux/MacOS

- Install rustup and cargo by running this command in the terminal. (Note : You may need to reopen the terminal after this command executes.)  
  `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`

- Install the mdBook CLI from cargo  
  `cargo install mdbook`
- Check version of mdBook installed to verify the installation was successful
  `cargo -V`

### Windows

- Install [rustup and cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- To use cargo, you may need to have C/C++ Build tools. If you donâ€™t have it installed, there are two options, choose either one.
  - GNU C Compiler : Install it using the following commands `rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` `rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
  - Visual Studio C++ Build Tools : Install C++ build tools from this [link](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools)
- Install the mdBook CLI from cargo : `cargo install mdbook`

- Check version of mdBook installed to verify the installation was successful : `cargo -V`

You could go through [mdBook Handbook](https://phaiax.github.io/mdBook/README.html) to get more familiar with mdBook.
